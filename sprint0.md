# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: Monday 1/29 - Monday 2/5 at beginning of class
* There will be no quiz for this sprint.  Normally, quiz time would be Monday, 2/5 at the beginning of class.  This time, we will spend this time presenting projects instead.
* Requirements due Monday, 2/5 at the beginning of class.
* Rationale: 

Sprint 0 will get you acclimated to the unique way the class will be run.  There will be NO quiz for this sprint - I just want to iron out the process with you.  During this sprint, we will do some background work learning about scrum (and the online tool Trello) as well as some basics of Discrete Math (like what it is!).  You will be responsible for knowing some basic Math notation and definitions that will help us all be on the same page from here on out.  You will come up with creative ways to express these math concepts to your peers. All of these requirements are trying to pave the way for the rest of the course: giving us shared tools, shared knowledge base, and shared vocabulary.

I am having you read a little out of a book I love called How to Bake Pi.  It is not a technical book - it is a general book that defines Math using the metaphor of cooking.  I am also having you read from a non-technical book about the value of Scrum, the methodology we will be using in this course.  It is from Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time, written by one of the founders of Scrum. It is about why Scrum works, and it is the book I was reading when I thought of the idea for how to run this course.  I find both of these inspirational and I'm hoping you will, too. 

# Responsibilities (What you need to know):
1. Definition of Discrete Math
  * What is Discrete Math?
  * Why do we learn it?
  * Why is it especially appropriate for Computer Scientists to know?
2. Scrum Processes
  * Define "Backlog", "Burndown charts", "Planning Poker", "Retrospective"
  * Why do we use Scrum?  How is it related to Agile?  What are the core values of each?
  * Be able to use the Trello software.  
3. Basic Math Notations and Definitions - Content from online textbook chapter 1
  * Sets & Subsets
  * Cartesian Products
  * Functions
  * Binary Relations
  * Propositions and Logical Operations
  
# Requirements (What you need to do):

## Individual Requirements:
  * Understand the concepts on the Responsibilities list.
  * Read about Scrum.  Link to pdf is on Canvas.
  * Get an account on Trello.com.  Google "Scrum for Trello" and "Burndown for Trello" and install both these extensions.

## Team Requirements:
  * Set up a shared board on Trello with your tasks for Sprint 0.  Add me to your board, too.
  * Do this problem set.
  * Project:  Think about the most inspirational things you learned from EITHER (not both, please) the Scrum or Pi readings. Your task is to find a creative way to present what you learned.  You may create a song, a story, a game, an animation, a skit, a visual, or any other creative means you can think of.  It cannot be a textbook-like essay.  You will present these on Monday at the beginning of class, and you will have no more than 5 minutes.  Your goals are to create something that is:
  * Engaging (not boring)
  * Accurate 
  * Interesting: make your audience think about the material in a different way or from a different point of view.  In other words, don't just recite the material.  We all read it already, so we are ready to dig deeper.
Half your "Requirements" grade is the project and the other half is the problem set.  The scrum artifacts will be graded in a "Scrumage" grade.

# Resources:  
I may add to these as we go through the sprint.  Use this Expert Request for more resources. 

  * ZyBook chapter exercises for chapter 1
  * Math quick-reference sheet (This is the material I would provide on a quiz.  You don't have to memorize it.)
  * Discrete Math definition (Also includes a tutorial on basic notation).
  * Video tutorials on Scrum & Agile.  There are tons.  Check out YouTube.  I also have books on the subject, if you would like.
  * Lecture slides on Chapter 1 
  * Worksheet on Chapter 1 
  * Answers to Worksheet
  * Game Idea 

# Reality Check:
  * On Monday, do basic team setup and introductions.  Do sprint planning meeting.
  * Homework for Wednesday:  Get Trello accounts and do 2 readings (Scrum and Pi).
  * Wednesday class: Make sure everyone's on Trello.  Discuss the definitions of Discrete and Scrum if there are any questions.  Do the project together.
  * Homework for Friday: Read and work through chapter 1 in zybook.  Do worksheet.
  * Friday class: Lecture on Chapter 1.  Check worksheet & make sure everyone understands. Do problem set together.
  * Weekend: Polish project with team.  Practice your presentation.
  * Monday: Present your project & turn in your problem set.
