# Roadmap:
* Teams
* Sprint Duration: Tuesday 1/14 - Tuesday 1/28 at beginning of class
* Quiz time is Tuesday, 1/28 at the beginning of class.
* Requirements due Monday, 2/5 at the beginning of class.

# Rationale: 
Sprint 1 will get you acclimated to the unique way the class will be run.  The first part is ironing out the Scrum process with you.  During this sprint, we will do some background work learning about Scrum (and the online tool Trello) as well as review some basics of Discrete Math (MAT140).  You will be responsible for knowing some basic Math notation and definitions that will help us all be on the same page from here on out.  You will do a couple of problem sets.  All of these requirements are trying to pave the way for the rest of the course: giving us shared tools, shared knowledge base, and shared vocabulary.

I am having you read from a non-technical book about the value of Scrum, the methodology we will be using in this course.  It is from Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time, written by one of the founders of Scrum. It is about why Scrum works, and it is the book I was reading when I thought of the idea for how to run this course.  I find this reading inspirational, and I'm hoping you will too. 

# Responsibilities (What you need to know):
1. Scrum Processes
  * Define "Backlog", "Burndown charts", "Planning Poker", "Retrospective"
  * Why do we use Scrum?  How is it related to Agile?  What are the core values of each?
  * Be able to use the Trello software.  
2. Review Logic Basics
  * Variables and propositions
  * Conjunction, disjunction, negation, conditional, biconditional, exclusive or - logic, operators, and notation
  * How to draw and complete truth tables
  * Logical equivalence, tautologies, contradictions
  * Be able to form the contrapositive, converse, and inverse of propositions
  * Predicate logic
  * Quantifiers (universal and existential)
3. Review Set Basics
  * Basic vocabulary: elements, empty set, proper subset
  * Union, intersection, difference, disjoint of sets
  * Set notation (see table 2.1)
  * Boolean algebra of sets 
4. Basic data represetation
  * Convert decimal to binary representation
  * Convert binary to hexadecimal
  * Be able to apply bitwise logical operators
5. 
  
# Requirements (What you need to do):

## Individual Requirements:
  * Understand the concepts on the Responsibilities list.
  * Read about Scrum.  Link to pdf is on Canvas.
  * Get an account on Trello.com.  Google "Scrum for Trello" and "Burndown for Trello" and install both these extensions.

## Team Requirements:
  * Set up a shared board on Trello with your tasks for Sprint 0.  Add me to your board, too (user id: vsummet)
  * Do these two problem sets.

The "Requirements" grade is the problem set.  The scrum artifacts will be graded in a "Scrumage" grade.

# Resources:  
I may add to these as we go through the sprint.  Use the Expert Request for more resources. 
  * [Tutorial Point series on Discrete Math](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/discrete_mathematics/discrete_mathematics_introduction.htm) (up through section on Propositional Logic).
  * Math quick-reference sheet (This is the material I would provide on a quiz.  You don't have to memorize it.)
  * Textbook: 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 2.1-2.4
  * [Overview of Scrum workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=gy1c4_YixCo) (YouTube, 2min)
  * Video tutorials on Scrum & Agile.  There are tons.  Check out YouTube and Lynda.com.  I also have books on the subject, if you would like.
  * How to draw truth tables. 
  * Lecture slides on Chapter 1 
  * Worksheet on Chapter 1 
  * Answers to Worksheet
  * Game Idea 

# Reality Check:
  * On Tuesday, do basic team setup and introductions.  Do sprint planning meeting.  Work on syllabus worksheet.
  * TODO by next class:  Get Trello accounts and do Scrum reading. Skim worksheet and problem set, noting problems you have no idea where to start or are confused by.
  * Thursday class: Make sure everyone's on Trello.  Discuss the definitions of Scrum if there are any questions. Enter deliverables on Trello, categorize them into In-Progress and Backlog, and assign topics based on topics you had issues with.
  * TODO by next class: Read and work through textbook readings.  Do worksheet(s), focusing on areas you're having trouble with.
  * Tuesday: Check worksheet & make sure everyone understands. Start problem set together. Check/Ask professor for help if you're stuck.  Play game together.
  * TODO by Thursday: Have "rough draft" answers for all problems in problem set.  Some may still need group discussion or further clarification.
  * Thursday: Do final check of problem set.  Make sure problem set is neat, tidy, and meets guidelines.  Turn in your problem set at the end of class.
  * TODO before next class: Play review game if you haven't alreay. Study as a group.
  * Next Tuesday: Quiz (30 minutes), Sprint 1 retrospective, and Sprint 2 planning.

# Retrospective:
  * Complete this survey.
