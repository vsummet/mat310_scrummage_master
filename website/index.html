I will maintain your grades on Blackboard using the above category weightings so that you may track your progress.  Should you find a grade recorded incorrectly, please bring it to my
attention immediately.
<br><br>
The homework assignments are significant programming projects using C and Java.
There will be approximately
six homework assignments (every two or three weeks, depending on
difficulty) and they will all be equally weighted in the calculation
of your final grade. <b>Start the homework early</b>. Don't wait until the last minute.
<br><br>
The midterm will cover material from the first half of the class. The
final is cumulative, but 
will be weighted towards material covered since the midterm. See the <it>Important Dates</it> section below for the dates of these exams this semester.  DO NOT MISS THESE! The final exam 
will not be rescheduled except in emergency cases with documentation provided. Leaving early for the summer or spring break is never an emergency.
<br><br>
Disputes of grading on assignments,
exams, etc must be discussed within one week of their
return or posting. While I will quickly correct small, bookkeeping
errors, you may be asked to submit a written argument justifying why
your work deserves a higher score.

<h3>Course Policies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attendance: The only way to be consistently successful in
your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and
participate in class activities.  Therefore, while I do not mandate
attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time
we meet. When you miss a lecture, you are
responsible for catching up with the material.  Most in-class activities cannot
be made up if you are absent.  Should you need to miss clas for religious activities, you must notify me by email of the dates and times of these absences by the end of the drop/add period.</li>

<li>Laptops:  If you have a laptop, please bring it to class so we
can use it for in-class programming activities.  Laptops are permitted
for in-class programming activities only.</li>

<li>Phones:  Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones
during class.  Please silence your phones at the beginning of class.
Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and
disrespectful. </li>

<li>Late Submissions: Assignments are due on the stated day at the
stated time.  Assignments submitted by the next class period will
incur a penalty of 10%.
Any work not submitted by the next class period will receive a 0. For
example, if an assignment is due "By the start of class on Monday",
you would have until the start of class on Wednesday to turn the
assignment in for the late penalty.  After class on Wednesday, you
would not be permitted to submit your assignment.</li>

<li>Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult
  for you to succeed in class.  We can always work out a plan to deal
with illness, work, or family responsibilities. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Necessary and Proper Clause</h3>
As the instructor, I will make every effort to adhere to the
topics and schedule described in this syllabus.  However, I reserve
the right to make changes for the good of the course. 

<h3>Honor Code</h3>
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an
obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all
things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor -
honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility - particularly
manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part
of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit
themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation
process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to
uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their
activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student
signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the
student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:  
 
<blockquote>
The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to
a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College
community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show
my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating,
or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly,
respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships
with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits
work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the
paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:<br><br>

 <b>"On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed
   any unauthorized assistance on this work."</b>
</blockquote>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge;
submission implies signing the pledge. <br><br>

 <b>How do I interpret the Honor Code?</b><br>
 In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code
 pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be
 <b>your own original creation</b>.  This means that any item you
 submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group
 project by your group alone.  Copying a solution from fellow class
 members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a
 violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.   
 <br><br>
  <b>What is acceptable collaboration?</b><br> 
  It is acceptable to talk about problems and solutions with other
  members of the class in general terms.  If you're talking about how
  you might solve a problem, or discussing how to use features of
  Java, that is generally allowed.  Copying or sharing code, even if
  you change the code in small ways, is definitely not permitted.  
  <br><br>
  It
  is acceptable to consult books and Internet resources like
  StackOverflow for general programming questions---I consider this to
  be documentation---but it is not acceptable to copy entire solutions
  from other sources.
  <br><br>
  <b>How do I document my collaboration?</b><br>
  You must thoroughly document any other
  students or outside materials you consult in the course of
  completing an assignment.  For example, if you consult Stack
  Overflow, you should copy and paste that URL into the README.md file in your
  GitHub repo for that assignment.  If you consult with another student, you should
  include their name as well.  There is <b>no penalty</b> for
  appropriate collaboration, and documenting other students and/or
  sources consulted will not impact your grade on the assignment.
  <br><br>

  <b>Please ask if you have questions about what is
  permissible!</b>

<h3>Accessibility Services</h3>
Rollins College is committed to equal access and inclusion for all
students, faculty and staff. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 create a foundation of legal
obligations to provide an accessible educational environment that does
not discriminate against persons with disabilities. It is the spirit
of these laws which guides the college toward expanding access in all
courses and programs, utilizing innovative instructional design, and
identifying and removing barriers whenever possible. 
<br><br>
If you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type
of academic accommodations in order to fully participate in your
classes, please contact the Office of Accessibility Services, located
on the first floor of the Olin Library, as soon as possible. You are
encouraged to schedule a Welcome Meeting by filling out the ?First
Time Users? form on the website:
<a href="http://www.rollins.edu/accessibility-services/">
http://www.rollins.edu/accessibility-services/</a>
 and/or reach out by
phone or email: 407-975-6463 or Access@Rollins.edu. 
<br><br>
All test-taking accommodations requested for this course must first be
approved through the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS) and
scheduled online through Accommodate at least 72 hours before the
exam. Official accommodation letters must be received by and discussed
with the faculty in advance. There will be no exceptions given unless
previously approved by the OAS with documentation of the emergency
situation. We highly recommend making all testing accommodations at
the beginning of the semester. OAS staff are available to assist with
this process. 

<h3>Credit Hour Statement</h3>

Rollins College offers four-credit-hour courses that provide three
(50-minute) hours of direct or indirect instructional contact. The
value of four credit hours reflects the substantial individual
attention each student receives from instructors as well as additional
out-of-class activities. Faculty require that students undertake at
least 7.5 (60-minute) hours of outside work per week, averaged over
the course's duration and equaling two and one-half (2.5) 60-minute
hours of outside work for every one (50 minute) hour of scheduled
class time. In this course, the additional outside-of-class
expectations are substantial programming projects, technical reading,
and written assignments utilizing the computer systems concepts
presented in class. 

<h3>Title IX Statement</h3>

Rollins College is committed to making its campus a safe place for
students. If you tell any of your faculty about sexual misconduct
involving members of the campus community, your professors are
required to report this information to the Title IX Coordinator. Your
faculty member can help connect you with the Coordinator, Oriana
Jiménez (TitleIX@rollins.edu or 407-691-1773). She will provide you
with information, resources and support. If you would prefer to speak
to someone on campus confidentially, please call the Wellness Center
at 407-628-6340. They are not required to report any information you
share with the Office of Title IX. <br><br>

Sexual misconduct includes sexual harassment, stalking, intimate
partner violence (such as dating or domestic abuse), sexual assault,
and any discrimination based on your sex, gender, gender identity,
gender expression or sexual orientation that creates a hostile
environment. For information, visit <a href="http://www.rollins.edu/titleix/"> http://www.rollins.edu/titleix</a>

<h3>Absences---religious holidays and/or campus business</h3>

The professor will accommodate a reasonable number of excused absences
for religious holidays and official off-campus college business such
as academic conference presentations and athletic
competitions. However, per the <a href="http://www.rollins.edu/catalogue/academic\_regulations.html\#class-attendance">College's policy on excused absences</a>,
 students must discuss with the professor the dates of the anticipated
 absences no later than the last day of the drop period. 
Students must
 present to their professor written evidence of the anticipated
 absences and discuss with him/her how and when make-up work should be
 completed prior to missing the class. Students should not expect to
 receive allowance for excused absences if they do not meet with the
 professor beforehand and clarify the dates as necessary. Absences
 will be addressed by the faculty member in accordance with his/her
 attendance policy. The professor retains the right to determine what
 would be considered to be a reasonable number of absences (excused or
 otherwise) for the course. A student will not fail a course because
 the number of religious observances and/or college business absences
 exceed the number of absences allowed, except if excessive absences
 make it impossible to fulfill the expectations of the course. The
 student's class participation grade in the course, though, may still
 be affected. 

<h3>Recording Device Use</h3>
In order to protect the integrity of the classroom experience, the use
of recording devices is limited to either the expressed permission of
the faculty member or with proper documentation from the Office of
Accessibility Services. Information about accommodations through
Accessibility Services can be found at
<a href="http://www.rollins.edu/accessibility-services/">
http://www.rollins.edu/accessibility-services/</a>. Recording without the
proper authorization is considered a violation of the Rollins Code of
Community Standards. 

 <h3>Course and Instructor Evaluations</h3>
 At the end of each semester, students are asked to evaluate the
 course and instructor. These evaluations are extremely valuable in
 the teaching and learning process on our campus. Student evaluations
 help assess student perceptions of classroom learning and often lead
 to improved teaching.  Your feedback is important and Rollins
 students are encouraged to be honest, fair, and reflective in the
 evaluation process. <br><br>
 
The online evaluative survey is anonymous. Students are never
identified as the respondent.  Instead, each student's comments are  
assigned a random number.  You will be asked to rate your course and
instructor on a numerical scale and through narrative comments. <br><br>

The online Course and Instructor Evaluation (CIE) process is open for
2 weeks and is well publicized. You will receive multiple emails for
each class, and I will remind you when the evaluations are open.
The evaluation period ends prior to the start of final
examinations and faculty cannot access completed evaluations until 10
days after the end of final exams.
