One of my goals for you this semester is to allow you to explore an aspect of the course that is of interest to you.  As a class, we'll build a timeline of crucial events, people, and schools of thought that are related to the material we're learning this semester.  In keeping with the Scrum principle of ... class members will be able to work at their own pace and self-organize the project.

Knightlab's TimelineJS provides a great (and easy?) way to create a timeline.  Here are some fun examples for you to browse through:
* [The Collapse of Microsoft and Nokia's Mobile Business](https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/22/microsoft-mobile-timeline/)
* [IRS Rarely Audits Non-Profits for Politicking](https://publicintegrity.org/federal-politics/irs-rarely-audits-nonprofits-for-politicking/) (scroll down in the article)
* [Mandela: A Life in Purpose](http://world.time.com/2013/12/05/nelson-mandelas-extraordinary-life-an-interactive-timeline/)

As you can see, these timelines can be incredibly informative and engaging with small amounts of text, but a lot of vizualization.  It turns out that the timeline is built on a Google spreadsheet that's formatted in a specific format.  We'll share one spreadsheet in the class, and you will each add your own contributions to the final product.

For this project, you will:
1. Pick topics: choose 1 from each column below.  Sign-up so that your topic is clearly marked.  No duplication!
2. Find an image or other media artifact for each of your topics.  Read at least 3 popular sources about each topic (one may be Wikipedia).
3. Citations for everything!
4. Summarize each topic in 1 paragraph specifically focusing on relevance to math and/or computer science as we've discussed in this course
5. Post to knightlabs class timeline <link to shared google spreadsheet here>

## Possible topics:
### People
Alan Turing | Grace Hopper | Noam Chomsky
Bertrand Russell | Alonzo Church | Kathleen Antonelli
