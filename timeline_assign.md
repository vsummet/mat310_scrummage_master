Timeline Assignment:
Part 1: Due <date here>
Part 2: Due <date here>

One of my goals for you this semester is to allow you to explore how mathematics evolved and computer science eventually became a separate discipline.  Moreover, I want you to be able to explore people/topics that are of interest to you.  As a class, we'll build a timeline of crucial events, people, and schools of thought that are related to the material we're learning this semester.  In keeping with the Scrum principle of flexibility, class members will be able to work at their own pace and self-organize the project.

Knightlab's TimelineJS provides a great (and easy?) way to create a timeline.  Here are some fun examples for you to browse through:
* [The Collapse of Microsoft and Nokia's Mobile Business](https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/22/microsoft-mobile-timeline/)
* [IRS Rarely Audits Non-Profits for Politicking](https://publicintegrity.org/federal-politics/irs-rarely-audits-nonprofits-for-politicking/) (scroll down in the article)
* [Mandela: A Life in Purpose](http://world.time.com/2013/12/05/nelson-mandelas-extraordinary-life-an-interactive-timeline/)

As you can see, these timelines can be incredibly informative and engaging with small amounts of text, but a lot of vizualization.  It turns out that the timeline is built on a Google spreadsheet that's formatted in a specific format.  As a class, we'll share one spreadsheet, and you will each add your own contributions to the final product.

For this project, you will:
## Part I
1. Pick topics: choose 1 from each table below.  Sign-up <link here> so that your topic is clearly marked.  No duplication; you cannot sign-up for a topic someone else has already signed up for and topics are first-come-first-served.
2. Find an image, video, map, sound clip or other media artifact for each of your topics.  Read at least 2 popular sources about each topic (you may not use Wikipedia as one of your sources, but it's fine to start there for an overview).
3. Citations for everything, incuding the media artifacts.  
## Part II
4. Summarize each topic in a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) specifically focusing on relevance to math and/or computer science as we've discussed in this course
5. Post to knightlabs class timeline <link to shared google spreadsheet here>
