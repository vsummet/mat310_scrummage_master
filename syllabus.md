**Catalog description:** Catalog description: Builds on the foundation established in Introduction to Discrete Mathematics. Topics include, but are not restricted to, combinatorics and graph theory, Boolean algebra, digital logic circuits, functional programming, models of computation, and computational complexity. Prerequisite: MAT 140.

**A Better description:** In your first course you learned the basics of some of the many concepts that make up the general study of discrete math. Now, our goal is to develop more of an understanding and appreciation of the rich interplay between mathematics and computer science. Prior to the advent of electronic computers, discrete math was a pretty obscure branch of mathematics. This course aims to tell the story of how it became an important applied area of study. We will see how the computer itself is a physical embodiment of Boolean logic; how programming languages and compilers are constructed from the mathematics of automata theory; that recursive functions serve as a basis of computation; and weâ€™ll see how computational theory shows us the limits of computation. We will also do some basic Racket programming. Racket is a functional language, that is, everything in Rack is a recursive function. While you are probably familiar with procedural programming, it is important to understand more than one programming paradigm.

**Goals and Objectives:**

**Scrummage and Grades:** We will be using a new class management technique called Scrumage in our course. This takes the
"agile" principles of Scrum used in software companies and applies it to the class environment. You
will be choosing how you want to learn, learning collaboratively, reflecting on the process, and
constantly re-evaluating your choices to make the class an ever-evolving, ever-improving learning
experience.

As such, the course content will be broken into 7 sprints. Each sprint
is one two-week unit of material, with a problem set or project, quiz, and Scrumage grade. The Scrumage
grade reflects your participation in meetings, use of the Scrum board, completing retrospectives, and
being a valuable team member.

Your grade will be determined by:
* 7 sprint deliverables: 40%
* 7 quizzes: 35%
* 7 Scrum grades: 10% 
* Final Exam: 15%

Letter grades: 
* [93-100]: A
* [90-93): A-
* [87-90): B+
* [83-87): B
* [80-83): B-
* [77-80): C+
* [73-77): C
* [70-73): C-
* [67-70): D+
* [63-67): D
* [60-63): D-
* [0-60): F

**Sprints:**
* Sprint 1: Propositional Logic and Set Theory review
* Sprint 2: Data Representation and Circuits, Boolean Algebra
* Sprint 3: Regular Expressions, FSA, NDFSA, Reg. Languages, Non-regular languages
* Sprint 4: Grammars: CFGs, Parsing and Parsers, Compilers
* Sprint 5: Pushdown Automata, Non-CFGs, General Grammars
* Sprint 6: Turing Machines, Computability, Limits of Computation
* Sprint 7: Recursion, Recursive Definitions
